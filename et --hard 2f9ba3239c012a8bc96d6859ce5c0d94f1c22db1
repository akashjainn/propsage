    Fix CFB player search to include Ryan Puglisi and Georgia roster
    
    CRITICAL FIX: Ensure Georgia QB Ryan Puglisi shows up in search results
    
    üîç Enhanced Player Search:
    - Prioritize key teams including Georgia in roster loading
    - Added Georgia-specific roster fallback to guarantee coverage
    - Increased team limit from 25 to 35 to include more rosters
    - Added live player search fallback via CFBD API when no cached results
    
    üèà Georgia-Specific Fixes:
    - Explicit Georgia roster loading if not found in initial batch
    - Team alias support: 'uga', 'georgia', 'bulldogs' all map to Georgia
    - Enhanced search logic to handle multi-word queries properly
    - Live search integration for missing players like Ryan Puglisi
    
    üìä Search Improvements:
    - Better relevance scoring prioritizing QBs for prop betting
    - Fuzzy matching with team nickname support
    - Fallback to live CFBD search when cached data is insufficient
    - Console logging for debugging missing player issues
    
    This ensures Ryan Puglisi (Georgia QB) and other key players show up in search results for the CFB demo.
