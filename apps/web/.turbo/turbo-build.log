      'Maiava has thrown interceptions in 3 of his last 4 starts, averaging 1.2 per game',
      'Opponent defense ranks #12 nationally in interceptions with 18 picks this season',
      'USC offensive line allows pressure on 42% of dropbacks, forcing rushed decisions',
      'Weather conditions show 15+ mph winds which historically increase INT rates by 23%'
    ],
    analysis: "Video analysis shows Maiava struggling with pocket presence under pressure, particularly on third downs where he's forced 6 interceptions this season. The opposing secondary has excellent ball skills and creates 2.1 turnover opportunities per game. Combined with USC's porous pass protection, we project a 67% chance of 1+ interceptions."

      'Opponent defense allows 4th most passing yards per game (289.3)',
      'Key receiver Adonai Mitchell is healthy after missing 2 games with injury'
    ],
    analysis: "Film study reveals Ewers has exceptional accuracy on intermediate routes (15-25 yard range) where he completes 73% of attempts. The opposing defense struggles with crossing routes and RPOs, which comprise 31% of Texas' passing offense. Weather conditions are ideal with no wind or precipitation expected."

      'Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart has 68% completion rate when targeting Harris',
      'Harris averages 12.1 targets per game, with 89% coming from slot formation'
    ],
    analysis: "Breakdown of defensive film shows the opponent consistently struggles with pick plays and bunch formations, which are Harris' specialty routes. He runs 67% of his patterns from the slot where he's most effective. The defensive coordinator has shown reluctance to double-team slot receivers, creating favorable 1-on-1 matchups."
