# PropSage â€” HackGT 12 Submission

## Inspiration
Sports prop betting moves fast on news, injuries, and role changes, but users lack real-time synthesis of context and quantitative fair values. We built PropSage to bridge that gap with grounded AI evidence and explainable pricing.

## What it does  
PropSage ingests player prop lines and computes fair values using a Bayesian model enhanced by:
- **Perplexity Search**: Grounded news evidence with citations
- **TwelveLabs Video**: Similar-scenario clips for context
- **Live Monte Carlo**: Real-time edge scoring with confidence bands

## How we built it
- **Frontend**: Next.js with WebSocket client for live updates
- **Backend**: Node.js API integrating Perplexity + TwelveLabs APIs
- **Core**: TypeScript pricing engine with Web Worker Monte Carlo
- **Data**: Cached fallbacks for demo reliability
- **Deploy**: Railway (API) + Vercel (web) with Docker containers

## Challenges we ran into
- **ESM Module Resolution**: Fixed import paths for containerized deployment
- **API Rate Limits**: Implemented exponential backoff + caching strategies  
- **Data Path Issues**: Resolved file system paths across development/production
- **Git Secrets**: Cleaned API keys from commit history for security

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Sub-300ms UI updates** with client-side Monte Carlo simulation
- **Grounded evidence integration** showing real news citations
- **Graceful offline mode** with cached demo data
- **Production-ready deployment** on Railway + Vercel

## What we learned
- Modern sports betting needs explainable, not just accurate, predictions
- API integration requires robust error handling + fallback strategies
- Real-time UX demands careful latency optimization
- Hackathon demos need offline backup modes

## What's next for PropSage
- **Open source** the core pricing models for community contribution
- **Pilot integration** with PrizePicks sandbox feeds
- **Parlay modeling** with correlation-aware risk calculations
- **Voice queries** and mobile-optimized interface
